This project integrates wxWidgets with Ruby and Bowline.
The public API documentation is in the Bowline project:
  http://github.com/maccman/bowline

* OSX only (for the moment) due to  wx/html/webkit.h
* uses wxWidgets 2.9
* uses Ruby 1.9
* uses the Rice 1.3.0 gem (http://github.com/jameskilton/rice)

You'll need to statically compile Ruby and wxWidgets:

  Ruby 1.9.1 configuration:
    ./configure --with-static-linked-ext --program-suffix=19 --prefix=/usr/local

  wxWidgets configuration:
    ./configure --disable-shared
    
Run rake to compile.
